Inspired by Blob Hero, this small game prototype was made for mobile platforms by two developers. The object of the game is to kill all your enemies and collect as many coins as possible while doing so.

Game controls are provided with a joystick. When the sufficient number of coins is reached, the features of the current weapon can be increased(number of bullets, bullet speed, and bullet damage) or a different weapon can be switched. There are four different weapons in total. There are standard coins that appear when enemies die, and more valuable coins that randomly appear independently. There are three different groups of enemies and a boss. In order to win the game, it is necessary to get rid of all these enemies.
